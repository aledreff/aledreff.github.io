    <p>"<a href="https://editentites.bandcamp.com/album/gwerz-boy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwerz Boy</a>" is the name of the "chip-trad" album I released in May 2023 (a "Gwerz" is a type of Breton song).
    "Gwerzboy" is the name of the gameboy videogame I entirely developped to go with the release of my album. <br>
    The songs of my album were composed on two trackers, LSDJ and Dirtywave M8.
    The idea was to replace the CD with a cartridge, on which you could listen to the songs generated in real-time by the gameboy sound processor. 
    A minigame was added to illustrate one of the songs, "Brestois plutôt que Français".
    The game was built with GBStudio and is available both as a Gameboy cartridge and an in-browser game. 
 </p>

    <blockquote><p>Enjoy the 6 tracks of the album in their chiptune arrangement, with illustrations by Maître Selecto in 160x144px and 4 shades of green !
    <br>Visit Brest to help Georges, bothered by the cops !</p></blockquote><br>

    <br>
    
    <p>A video illustrating one of the song was also created using a custom version of the game and real-time corruption techniques on the ROM. <br>
        The result is a glitchy pixel-art Breton karaoke ⚘ </p>
